Thank you Paul Hudson for writing [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read). Infact all his books Rocks! :+1:

Thank you Joe Heck for writing [**Using Combine**](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/) it rocks :+1:

Made this small simple little app while understanding Combine. 

Thanks to all other authors at wenderlich.com, objc.io, Azamsharp, Kilo, plus all at medium.com 

App content & what it does.
1. The app is an re-rewrite Project 7  of Hacking with Swift by Paul Hudson using SwiftUI & Combine
2. The app receives the data from an URL which sends output in JSON format.
3. The app uses SwiftUI & Combine framework to get the data & store it in our arrays of Petition model.
4. We display the stored data using List in SwiftUI. It displays title, body & url.
5. Once we click an row it will show body from Details.swift file.

That's all it does. 
Cheers!
